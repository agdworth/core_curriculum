Cardiac Output equals,Stroke Volume X Heart rate
Mean Arterial pressure can be calculated by,1/3 systolic pressure + 2/3 diastolic pressure
Stroke volume is the difference in which two ventricular volumes?,End Diastolic volume - End systolic volume
Ejection fraction equals,Stroke volume / End diastolic volume
What is a normal ejection fraction?,≥55%
What is preload?,ventricular end diastolic volume (preload is the amount of ventricular filling)
What is afterload?,Mean arterial pressure
What is the Frank-Starling law of the heart?,"The more the ventricle fills in diastole, the greater the contractility and hence stroke volume of the heart"
