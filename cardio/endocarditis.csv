What is the most common endocarditis pathogen in IV drug users?	Staph. Aureus (since it's found on the skin)
How does Staph. Aureus endocarditis present?	Acutely with more valvular/perivalvular destruction and high need for surgery
Why does infective endocarditis require a long course of antibiotics?	Antibiotics have poor penetration into vegetations (mix of organisms, platelets, fibrin-rich thrombus and inflammatory cells)
What is a vascular complication of endocarditis vegetations?	Infarcts or mycotic aneurysms. May need to do whole body angiogram.
Whar are common signs and symptoms of infective endocarditis?	Fever, murmur, chills
What is the commonest cause of splinter haemorrhages?	Trauma. If no traumatic history, may suggest infective endocarditis
Name four types of non-infective endocarditis?	Marantic - Associated with carcinoma (esp. bowel), Libman-Sacks (SLE), Loeffler's, DIC
What is the highest risk for endocarditis in young people?	IVDU
What % of valve recipients develop endocarditis in the first year?	1-4%
What is the treatment difference between normal valve endocarditis and prosthetic valve endocarditis?	prosthetic valve disease responds less well to Abx
What are the risk factors for endocarditis?	IVDU, prosthetic mitral valve, nosocomial (cannulae/catheter bacteraemia), structural heart disease (bicuspid aortic valve), degenerative valvular lesions (mitral valve prolapse, aortic stenosis), Hx of endocarditis
What is the most common cause of endocarditis globally?	streptococci (viridans s.) (staph more common in 1st world, tertiary hospitals)
What are the 2 forms of culture negative endocarditis?	True culture negative (eg. Q fever); those inadvertantly treated with Abx early leading to control of organism, but not disease process)
What peripheral embolic signs can be seen with IE?	splinter haemorrhages, Janeway lesions, focal neuro signs, micro haematuria
What peripheral immune complex signs can be seen with IE?	Osler's nodes (painful, raised on digits), glomerulonephritis, arthritis, Roth's spots (eyes)
What signs may be seen on CT with IE?	Psoas abscess, multiple lung emboli
What types of endocarditis are there other than infective endocarditis?	non-infective endocarditis (trauma from procedures, SLE, carcinomatous endocarditis)
What are risk factors for Q Fever?	Working in or living near and abattoir  travel to Middle East
What are the 2 applications of echocardiography in IE?	To look for lesions; to look for complications (valvular dysfn, abscess/fistula, LV dysfn)
Are mechanical or native replacement valves higher risk for IE?	Same
What is the commonest valve involved in IE?	Mitral
How many of Duke's criteria lead to a definitive diagnosis?	2 major or 1 major plus 3 minor or 5 minor
What are the major Duke's criteria?	Positive blood cultures for IE (multiple times  typical or consistent)  positive echocardiogram  new valvular regurgitation
What are the minor Duke's criteria?	Predisposing condition; fever; vascular phenomena; immunologic phnomena; positive blood culture not meeting major; echocardiograph findings consistent with IE, but not meeting major
What are some limitations of echocardiography?	Operator dependent; TTE is body shape dependent and low res; TOE is high res, but invasive
What are the gram-negative bacilli associated with IE?	HACEK: Haemophillus, Actinobacillus, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella
What is the most common bacterial agent for IE in new mechanical heart valve recipients?	Steptococcus epidermidis
What is the incidence of IE?	Not clear, but between 1.5-5 per 100,000 in the US. Men > Women
When should TOE be used in IE diagnosis?	When TTE result is unclear, or abscess/perforation suspected
What are some of the local consequences of IE?	myocardial abscesses, conduction disturbances, severe valvular regurg, aortitis
What may be seen on a FBC for IE?	anaemia, ESR, CRP
What is the basic requirement for IE	Damaged endothelium (valves, VSD, Chordae tendinae)
What is the most likely organism for acute IE?	Staph
What % of sufferers of IE have a risk factor?	50-75%
Is native valve or prosthetic valve more likely to be staph?	Prosthetic (early especially)
What % will present with a fever?	85%
What % will have a murmur at presentation?	85%
What would you use a Gallium scan for?	Find where the focus of WBC (and hence infn) in the body (remove pt's blood, label WBCs, re-inject, wait, scan). Use in ambiguous cases where pt has implanted device and source of infn unknown.
What is emprical Abx Rx for IE?	Broad spectrum (Vanc + Gent + 3/4 Gen Cefalosporin)
