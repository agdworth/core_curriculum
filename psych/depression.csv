T/F: all patients prescribed antidepressants should be informed about the delayed onset of effect	True, though whether there is in fact a delay in onset of action remains controversial
When is the frequency of side effects greatest in antidepressant therapy?	Most side effects are early onset and time limited (about 1-2 weeks)
T/F: it is important to emphasise to emphasuise the problems associated with abruptly stopping or reducing the dose of antidepressants	True.
Name 5 common symptoms abruptly discontinuing an antidepressant	Nausea, dizziness, paraesthesia, anxiety and headache.

The use of which SSRI/SNRIs is associated with withdrawal effects?	Paroxetine, venlafaxine and fluvoxamine
T/F: recent studies have suggested that serotonergic-noradrenergic antidepressant drugs seem to have greater efficacy compared to SSRIs in depression	True, recent studies have suggested that serotonergic-noradrenergic drugs, such as venlaxfaxine, mirtazapine and duloxetine, seem to have greater efficacy in depression than SSRIs
Name 3 serotonergic-noradrenergic antidepressants	Venlaxfaxine, mirtazapine and duloxetine
Why are tricyclic antidepressants considered less favourable in treating depression than newer agents?	False, tricyclic antidepressants are less favourable, not because they are less effective than the newer agents, but because they are more dangerous in overdose and less well tolerated 
T/F: serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors should not be prescribed to patients with severe or uncontrolled hypertension 	True. Blood pressure should be checked initially and regularly during treatment, particularly during dosage titration.
T/F: recent data suggest SSRIs may increase the risk of GI bleeding. 	True, this is due to action on serotonin release from platelets.
Co-administration of an SSRI and which other common drugs significantly increases the risk of GI bleeding?	The risk is significantly increased when an SSRI is combined with an NSAID or low-dose aspirin.
T/F: psychological therapy alone has not been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of depression	False, psychotherapy alone has proven efficacy for milder forms of depression 
T/F: Certain psychological therapies can be a useful adjunct to medication for more severe depression	True, certain psychological therapies can be a useful adjunct to medication for more severe depression
T/F: if a patient does not engage in psychotherapy initially, it is not worth reconsidering psychotherapy at a later date	False, patients who respond to medication may be in a better position to engage in psychotherapy, as they experience an improvement in motivation and concentration.
T/F: Certain psychological therapies may be associated with better relapse prevention	True. 
T/F: Treatment-resistant depression is generally defined as a failure of response to at least two antidepressants at therapeutic doses for at least two weeks	False, so-called 'treatment-resistant depression' is generally defined as a failure of response to at least two antidepressants at therapeutic dose for at least four weeks
T/F: general strategies for approaching patients with treatment-resistant depression include reviewing the diagnosis	True. Review the diagnosis, including past history (notably of any hypomanic or manic episodes), past treatments and treatment responses
T/F: general strategies for approaching patients with treatment-resistant depression include exploring comorbidities	True. Explore comorbidities including anxiety disorder, personality disorder, substance use and physical comorbidities
T/F: general strategies for approaching patients with treatment-resistant depression include checking that the patient has been compliant	True. Review treatments and ensure the patient has been adherent
T/F: there is no point switch from one SSRI to another SSRI, as the side effects are likely to be the same with both	False, it may be an option to swtich between two different SSRI agents and achieve a different response or alleviate troublesome side effects
T/F: withdrawal phenomena are only seen with antidepressants that affect the serotonergic system	False. All antidepressants have the potential to cause withdrawal phenomena if the patient has been on therapy for longer than six weeks.

T/F: cross-tapering is usually the preferred option for switching medications, with the exception of the MAOIs	True. This tends to avoid the potential for withdrawal phenomena. The speed of cross-tapering is best judged by patient tolerability.
