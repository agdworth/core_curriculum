T/F: Problems in mentalisation contribute to difficulties in understanding past trauma as abuse,"True. Problems in mentalisation contribute to difficulties in understanding past trauma as abuse, as the individual may not be able to understand why this abuse occurred.

T/F: All individuals with PDs have difficulties with attachment and interpersonal functioning,True.

T/F: Giving direct advice to patients with PD assists them to develop independence and therapeutic cooperation,"False.

T/F: Good collaboration and communication with other clinicians and services is essential,True.
"T/F: The management plan should document risk assessment, decisions, rationale for treatment and provisions for acute and emergency response",True.
T/F: Problems with transferrence and counter-transferrence are unlikely when multiple treatment services are involved,False. This is likely to magnify these issues.
"T/F: A specialist review is useful if there are complex comorbidities, treatment is not effective, or risk to the patient remains high",True.
T/F: Involving the patient's family in treatment is not recommended as it unnecessarily complicates treatment,False.
T/F:  Providing information about PD is particularly important when the patient may be looking for a 'physical' or medical explanation of their distress and is not open to psychological explanation,True.

T/F: Triggers for self-harming behaviour should be sought,True.
T/F: A history of suicidal and self-harming behaviours and feelings should be obtained,True.

"T/F: Antipsychotic medication is recommended for the treatment of emotional instability, transient psychotic symptoms and aggression",True.
T/F: Anticonvulsants such as valproate or carbamazepine can be used to regulate aggressive outbursts in patients with severe PD,"True, although side effects and risk in overdose may limit the use of these agents and suggest they be restricted to second-line."
T/F: Short-term sedative medication may be used as a part of crisis management,True.
T/F: The use of SSRI antidepressants should be avoided in patients with PD,False. RCTs have provided some support for use of these drugs in the treatment of depression in personality disorders and have demonstrated some effect on impulsive aggression.
