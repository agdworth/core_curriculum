"T/F: With respect to anorexia nervosa (AN) in Australian females, eating meals together as a family may protect against its development",True. Recent research is highlighting the significance of regular family meals as a protective factor against the development of eating disorders.
"T/F: There are 39 per 100,00 new cases of AN diagnosed in Australian females every year","False. Only 19 per 100,00 new cases of AN are diagnosed in Australian females each year. Given its chronic course, its incidence is markedly lower than its prevalence (0.5-1% in late adolescence)."
T/F: Loss of at least 25% of body weight is diagnostic for AN,False. Loss of > 15% of body weight is diagnostic.
"T/F: After puberty, eating disorders are 10-20 times more common in females",True. 
T/F: Bulimia nervosa (BN) is more common than anorexia nervosa,"True. Among adolescent women, the prevalence of AN is 0.5-1% in Australia; for BN it is 1-2%."
"T/F: For diagnosis of BN, bingeing and purging must occur daily for six months",False. Twice-weekly for three months.
T/F: Bulimia commonly presents in younger women more often than anorexia,"False. Bulimia nervosa presents later than anorexia nervosa, in the late teens or early 20s and is less common in pre-pubertal and early teenage years."

"T/F: In a patient with AN, testing electrolytes, urea and creatinine may demonstrate a hypokalaemic alkalosis",True. This is likely related to vomiting or laxative use.
T/F: The ECG of patient with AN may show 'u' waves,True. Abnormally prominent U waves are characteristically seen in severe hypokalaemia. They may also be seen with hypomagnesaemia.
"T/F: In a patient with AN, FSH levels would be high and oestradiol levels low, demonstrating hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis dysfunction ","False. While oestradiol levels may be low, FSH levels will also be low, excluding menopause and primary ovarian failure."

"T/F: Treatment of AN almost always involves inpatient care, so public hospital psychiatry beds are well coordinated for this",False. Inpatient treatment is advisable only if outpatient progress is poor or there significant medical problems. There is a dearth of treatment places in the public sector for patients over 16. 
"T/F: In treating AN in adolescent patients, medication is to be avoided as the long-term nature of the problem makes them unsuitable. ","False. Anxiety, insomnia and repitive thoughts about weight and food may respond to small doses of FGAs. Depressive symptoms might also require pharmacological treatment, preferably with an agent such as mirtazapine, which can induce weight gain. "
What are the 3 major components of all eating disorders?,"1) Psych issues (body dissatisfaction, addiction to diet/exercise), 2) Weight-losing behaviours (food restriction, vomiting, laxative abuse), 3) Medical issues (ECG abnormalities, osteoporois, salvary gland swelling)"

Such individuals have a higher rate and earlier occurrence of complications from their diabetes mellitus. When such young adults present to eating disorder services their disorder is often long-standing and there are already significant and irrever
T/F: Refeeding syndrome is caused by a rapid fall in sodium level,"False. It is caused by, at least in part, by a fall in phosphate levels when protein synthesis resumes. This fall has a deleterious effect on muscle (including cardiac muscle) contractility."
T/F: The risk fo refeeding syndrome is increased when BMI is less than 14,True.
"T/F: Features of refeeding syndrome include abdominal pain, severe vomiting and diarrhoea.","False. The clinical features are delirium, chest pain, heart failure and peripheral oedema."
T/F: Refeeding syndrome is best avoided by initially replacing nutrients and energy slowly.,True.
Deficiency of which vitamin is associated with the delirium seen in refeeding syndrome?,Thiamine (Vitamin B1). This is akin to Wernicke's encephalopathy without the toxic effects of alcohol.
