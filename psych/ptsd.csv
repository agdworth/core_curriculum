Men are more likely than women to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after exposure to the same traumatic event,False. Women are estimated to be fourfold more likely to develop PTSD after exposure to the safe traumatic event as men.
Prior trauma in childhood or adult life predisposes to PTSD after another traumatic event,True. There is good evidence to suggest this.
Pre-existing significant psychiatric disorders may predispose individuals to PTSD,True. They are an at-risk population.
Most people exposed to severe traumatic events will develop PTSD,"False. Many individuals experience traumatic events, but few develop full-blown PTSD."
"For the diagnosis of PTSD, the traumatic event must involve threat of (or actual) death or serious injury to the self or others",True.
"With PTSD, a child's response to the traumatic event must include overtly expressed intense fear, helplessness or horror.","False. In children, this may be expressed instead by disorganised or agitated behaviour."
"With PTSD, the person may have recurrent and intrusive distressing recollections of the event, including images, thoughts or perceptions","True. In young children, however, repetitive play may occur in which themes or aspects of the trauma are expressed."
"Acting and feeling as if the traumatic event were recurring (e.g. illlusions, hallucinations, dissociative flashbacks) indicates a psychotic illness and excludes a diagnosis of PTSD",False. This is one of the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. This includes those that occur on awakening or when intoxicated.
"Regarding the features of PTSD, avoidance symptoms include markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities",True.
"Avoidance of thoughts, feelings, conversations or situations associated with the trauma is a common symptom of PTSD",True.
The inability to recall an important aspect of the trauma excludes a diagnosis of PTSD,False. This is a common characteristic of PTSD
Feelings of detachment of estrangement from others that are out of character for that person may indicate 'numbing' resulting from the trauma,True.
"In PTSD, symptoms of increased arousal may include irritability or outbursts or anger, and difficulty concentrating",True.
"In PTSD, the duration of the characteristic symptoms is at least six months",False. It is more than one month.
The symptoms of avoidance and numbing that may occur with PTSD can also occur with depression ,True. 
"Avoidance behaviour may be a predictor of prolonged PTSD, that is, lasting several years",True.
"Most individuals with PTSD will have a coexistent depressive disorder, other anxiety disorder or substance-use disorder",True. Most people with PTSD will have at least one other comorbid psychiatric disorder. The most common are those listed.
Individuals with PTSD are not at increased risk of suicidal thinking or behaviour,False.
Patients with PTSD should be specifically advised to monitor and address alcohol and substance use,True.
"For patients with PTSD who do not need specialist referral, follow-up appointments with the GP are unnecessary",False. 
Exposure exercises target symptoms of increased arousal ,False. They target avoidance symptoms in PTSD.
"With in-vivo exposure, individuals are directly exposed, in a controlled and systematic manner, to situations that cue traumatic memories",True.
"With imaginal exposure the patient is exposed to a verbal account, rather than actual experience, of the traumatic memory in an office-based setting",True.
"Of the two forms of exposure, imaginal exposure is considered essential to the successful treatment of PTSD",False. In-vivo exposure is considered essential for the successful treatment of PTSD.
Cognitive restructuring is a technique that focuses on the avoidance behaviours of the PTSD syndrome,False. Cognitive restructuring is a technqiue that focuses on identifying anxiety-provoking thoughts that comprise part of the PTSD syndrome.
"With cognitive restructuring, the patient learns to systematically challenge maladaptive thoughts and replace them with more constructive ones",True.
De-arousal techniques such as relaxation target the autonomic symptoms of PTSD,True. 
The typical duration of CBT is six sessions,"False. While the frequency and duration of CBT sessions varies according to availability and patient resources, in general terms, 8-12 sessions of CBT are required to address symptoms."
"In eye-movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR), the patient focuses on a specific aspect of the traumatic event, describing the key image, and the associated emotional state, beliefs and somatic sensations",True. This occurs while the patient visually tracks the therapist's finger moving repeatedly back and forth across their visual field. 
"In EMDR, repetitive eye tracking movements are performed before the patient describes the traumatic event",False. These occur concurrently.
EMDR should be conducted in association with in-vivo exposure exercises.,True.
Homework' is an integral part of EMDR,"False. Unlike in CBT, homework is not prescribed in EMDR."
Antidepressants are effectve in the treatment of PTSD,True. There have been numerous RCTs and a number of systematic reviews that conclude that antidepressants are effective treatments for PTSD.
The benefit from use of antidepressants is not maintained on discontinuing the medication,True. There is a significant risk of relapse on discontinuation.
Antidepressants are as effective as CBT or EMDR in the treatment of PTSD,False. They do not generate the same magnitude of clinical improvement as empiracally validated psychological treatments.
"Benzodiazepines reduces the re-experiencing or avoidance symptoms, as well as reducing the level of arousal","False. Benzodiazepines do not reduce the re-experiencing or avoidance symptoms, despite reducing the level of arousal. Benzodiazepines are not recommended as monotherapy for the treatment of PTSD. They are relatively contraindicated in people with substan"
Single-session psychological debriefing reduces the immediate psychological distress associated with traumatic events,False.
Single-session psychological debriefing after a traumatic event prevents the development of PTSD,False.
Non-specific support psychotherapy is not an effective treatment for PTSD,True.
Generic anxiety management training is less effective than CBT or EMDR in the treatment of PTSD,True.
