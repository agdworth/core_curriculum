Why is it essential to ask patients who present with depression about any previous symptoms of mania or hypomania?	The treatment of unipolar and bipolar depression differs significantly
T/F: People with bipolar disorder commonly present clinically with symptoms of hypomania	False, people with bipolar disorder often consider periods of hypomania to be 'normal' and understandably regard them as desirable, and rarely present clinically with such symptoms.

T/F: mood lability is thought to be more common in bipolar depression than in unipolar depression	True, mood lability is thought to be more common in bipolar depression than in unipolar depression
What psychological comorbidities should be considered in people with bipolar disorder?	Common comorbidities are anxiety disorders and substance abuse
What are the features of mania? 	Abnormally and persistently elevated mood + FIDGETS: Flight of ideas, Insomnia, Distractibility, Grandiosity, Energetic and increased activities, Talkativeness, Socially inappropriate behaviour
T/F: in treating acute mania, hospitalisation or referral to a specialist for the purposes of monitoring mental state and treatment should be considered	True, in treating acute mania, hospitalisation or referral to a specialist for the purposes of monitoring mental state and treatment should be considered
T/F: about 3/4 of all people with mania will respond to monotherapy with any anti-manic agent	False, about half of all people with mania will respond to monotherapy with any antimanic agent
T/F: about 3/4 of all people with mania will respond to a combination of an atypical antipsychotic and either lithium or sodium valproate	True, about 3/4 of all people with mania will respond to a combination of an atypical antipsychotic and either lithium or sodium valproate
In less severe episodes of mania, where there is no immediate risk to the individual, would monotherapy or combination therapy be preferred?	Monotherapy with any anti-manic agent (e.g. sodium valproate or any atypical antipsychotic)
In more severe mania, such as cases requiring hospitalisation or when the individual poses a risk to themselves and others, would monotherapy or combination therapy be preferred? 	Combination therapy with an atypical antipsychotic and either lithium or sodium valproate
What are the first 3 steps to take after an initial assessment of a person with acute mania?	1. ensure the individual is safe and provide a calm and manageable environment. 2. promptly discontinue any medications that may promote mania, e.g. antidepressants. 3. initiate treatment with anti-manic agents
T/F: in treating bipolar depression, there is a clear consensus on the use of antidepressants	False, unlike in major depression, the use of antidepressants in bipolar disorder is somewhat controversial, and there remains a lack of consensuys regarding their place in therapy
T/F: the potential of antidepressants to increase cycling, shortening inter-episode periods and provoking a switch into mania, is greatest with the SSRIs	False, all antidepressants have this propensity to some degree, but tricyclics confer the greatest risk
T/F: there is substantive support for use of monotherapy with a mood stabiliser such as lithium , sodium valproate or lamotrigine as first-line treatment of bipolar depression	True, there is substantive support for use of monotherapy with a mood stabiliser such as lithium , sodium valproate or lamotrigine as first-line treatment of bipolar depression, and this course of action is advocated by several treatment guidelines
T/F: if antidepressants are used in bipolar disorder, they should not be used in the absence of a concomitant mood stabiliser	True, if antidepressants are used in bipolar disorder, they should not be used in the absence of a concomitant mood stabiliser, and even in these circumstances their use should probably be limited to short-term treatment.
T/F: during the maintenance phase of bipolar disorder the most common reason for relapse is lack of efficacy of the medication	False, during the maintenance phase of bipolar disorder the most common reason for relapse is treatment non-adherence
T/F: overall, most agents used in the maintenance phase of bipolar disorder have greater efficacy in preventing relapse into mania, than into depression	True, overall, most agents used in the maintenance phase of bipolar disorder have greater efficacy in preventing relapse into mania, with the exception of lamotrigine
T/F: a significant proportion of patients with bipolar disorder will need combinations of mood stabilisers for an adequate response	True, a significant proportion of patients with bipolar disorder will need combinations of mood stabilisers for an adequate response
T/F: in practice, an 'adequate trial' of maintenance treatment may require up to six months before effectiveness or lack of efficacy can be determined	False, an 'adequate trial' of maintenance treatment may require up to a year before effectiveness or lack of efficacy can be determined.
T/F: adjunctive psychotherapy has been shown to improve adherence to treatment in bipolar disorder	True, adjunctive psychotherapy has been shown to improve adherence to treatment in bipolar disorder. Most of the benefit has been seen in the maintenance phase of treatment.
In essence, all effective psychological interventions include which 3 features?	Psycho-education (about the disorder), promote individual adherence, and employ mood-monitoring and relapse-prevention strategies.
Which drugs have demonstrated efficacy in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder?	Lithium, some anticonvulsants (sodium valproate, lamotrigine), some atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, quetiapine)
