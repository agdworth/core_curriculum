T/F: Panic disorder may be simply defined as experiencing recurrent panic attacks,False. Panic attacks may occur in any anxiety disorder if fear and anxiety levels are high enough. Hence recurrent panic attacks themselves are not enough to make the diagnosis.
"T/F: In panic disorder, the key cognitions concern fears that physical symptoms of the panic attacks reflect serious underlying pathology","True. These beliefs are what drive the person's fears that panic attacks may lead to serious illness or death, or cause them to lose control or go insane."
"T/F: In panic disorder, the principal fears associated with panic attacks are that they will result in negative evaluations by others",False. This description characterises social anxiety disorder.
T/F: Panic disorder with agoraphobia occurs when a person avoids a range of situations out of fear over panic attacks,True.
"T/F: Panic attacks are common, with about one-quarter of respondents in a major US study reporting ever having had a panic attack",True.
T/F: Women and men are equally likely to experience panic disorder ,False. Women are affected 2-3 times as commonly as men.
T/F: Most people with panic disorder develop the condition before age 40,"True. Panic disorder develops typically in the late teens and 20s, with a spread between about 15 and 35-40 years."
T/F: About 7% of general practice attendees might meet criteria for panic disorder at any one time ,True.
"T/F: Risk factors for panic disorder have a strong biological basis, with heritable factors accounting for about 40% of the variance",True.
T/F: Nocturnal panic attacks represent a more severe variant of panic disorder ,False. Nocturnal panic attacks are common in panic disorder and the weight of evidence suggests that they do not represent a distinct or more severe variant.
T/F: In panic disorder it is usually possible to identify cues for the panic attacks,"True. Although the DSM-IV specifies ""recurrent unexpected panic attacks"" for a diagnosis of panic disorder, there is widespread agreement that, with the exception of the initial panic attack, this is not the most frequent experience of panic disorder. Aft"
T/F: The natural history of the panic spectrum is that it begins with a panic attack and progresses to panic disorder and then to agoraphobia,"False. Either disorder may precede the other, or present as a risk factor for the other."
"T/F: Panic disorder is commonly associated with other anxiety disorders, major depression and substance abuse","True. Panic disorder is a highly comorbid condition where other anxiety disorders, major depression and substance use (especially of alcohol) are common."
T/F: People with panic disorder have a greater likelihood of chronic pain and respiratory illness,True.
T/F: Several studies have shown that panic attacks are not an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD),"False.

T/F: Studies have shown a 2-4-fold increased risk of CHD in people with panic disorder ,True.
Name 3 subtle cues that may lead to a panic attack,"Missed heartbeat, change in temperature, or being under time pressure"

"T/F: In a patient with no past history of anxiety and no particular vulnerability factors, an alternative cause of the panic attacks should be suspected",True.
"T/F: Physical examination is not required in patients presenting for the first time with panic attacks, provided their symptoms are clearly consistent with panic disorder",False.
"T/F: In patients with longstanding panic attacks, reassessment of persistent symptoms is discouraged, as this will only worsen the anxiety symptoms",False.
"T/F: In patients with panic disorder, it is essential that depression is screened for and treated",True.
"T/F: The basis of managing panic disorder is to present an alternative hypothesis to the patient, i.e., that their symptoms indicate anxiety rather than serious physical illness",True.
"T/F: Warning patients about side effects of medication will cause them to experience them through suggestibility, so it is better not to tell them",False.
T/F: The combination of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy is proven to be more effective than either treatment alone,"False. Despite recent meta-analyses, the question of whether the combination opf CBT and pharmacotherapy is more effective than either treatment alone remains unresolved. "
T/F: There is level I evidence of efficacy for all available classes of antidepressants,True.
T/F: Benzodiazepines are not recommended as first-line or long-term therapy,True.
"T/F: Beta blockers, in particular propanolol, have been found to be effective",False.
T/F: There is currently no evidence of efficacy for antihistamines or antipsychotics,True.
T/F: A more sedating antidepressant is the best choice for highly anxious patients,False.
"T/F: When starting an antidepressant for panic disorder, it is most appropriate to start with half the minimum strength dose of the antidepressant",True.
"T/F: When started for panic disorder, SSRIs should routinely be combined with a benzodiazepine",False.
T/F: 12 weeks represents an adequate trial of an antidepressant when treating anxiety disorders,True.
"T/F: In treating anxiety, high doses of antidepressants are needed compared with depression",False.
"T/F: If a patient with panic disorder fails to respond to one medication in a class, there is no point trying another medication from the same class ",False.
T/F: Relapse rates are significantly reduced compared with placebo when antidepressant medication is continued for six months or more,True.
"T/F: When a decision is made to stop antidepressants, this should be done as a slow taper over about 3 months","True. This avoids any risk of rebound and allows time to make an adjustment. Unfortunately, relapse rates on cessation are high."
"T/F: In psychological therapy for panic disorder, hyperventilation control is an essential element","False. Hyperventilation control is no longer routinely taught as an 'anxiety management' strategy. It was realised that the original goal of CBT, to achieve 'control' over panic, did not address the fearof panic, and left the patient vulnerable to catastr"
"T/F: In treating panic disorder, CBT that incorporates interoceptive exposure is most effective","True. Deliberate exposure to worrying somatic symptoms, known as interoceptive exposure, is now an important part of exposure therapy "
"T/F: In agoraphobia, graded exposure to feared situations is an important element of treatment",True. 
"T/F: In treating panic disorder, the maintenance of treatment effects is much better after CBT than after a course of medication",True.
